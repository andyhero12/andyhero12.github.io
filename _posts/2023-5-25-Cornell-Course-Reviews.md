My thoughts on Cornell Courses I've taken. My experiences may differ from others due to the strict Covid-19 restrictions and virtual classes during my freshman year. The choice of classes I took and enjoyed mainly reflects my interest in computer systems rather than the more theoretical side of computer science.

I want to preface that the number of credits an average Cornell student takes is around 15 academic credits. I took 1-2 additional classes per semester compared to the average engineering student. Additionally, credit hours can be deceiving as some classes are much more work than their credits entail and vice versa. 

üëç indicates a class I really enjoyed.

‚≠ê indicates a transformative class I strongly recommend taking.

## Fall 2020 Difficulty: Medium
- Math 1920: Multivariable Calculus for Engineers

    Given that I had taken a simpler version of Multivariable Calculus in high school, the first half of the class was relatively simple. I did every problem in the textbook to ensure I understood the foundations of our learning. I finished over seven notebooks of writing just for homework, practice problems, and exams. The latter half of the course was new material and required much more thought and time to understand what was happening. Overall, an excellent introduction to my first college-level math course.

- ‚≠ê CS 1110: Intro Computing Using Python

    One of, if not the best introductory courses in computing (Fall Version with Professor Walker White). Although I never scored the high 90s on my exams, the foundational concepts, the weekly labs, projects, and lectures kept me motivated throughout the semester. Professor White made short 10-minute videos multiple times a week teaching the new topics covered and reinforced those ideas during the three lectures a week. The combination of self-studying alongside examples during lectures accelerated the rate of learning I achieved throughout the semester. Additionally, the class and projects were well structured, which helped people without any background in computer science. Each week we would cover new topics such as basic operators, objects, lists, and even generators.

    One regret I have is working with partners within the class. The projects aren't nearly large enough to warrant splitting up the work, and given that CS 1110 is an intro class, it takes away from an individual's learning. Through the projects, people should be encouraged to learn the core concepts. I routinely learned much more by debugging through tasks rather than immediately giving up, going to office hours, or asking my partner. The projects I worked alone on were far better learning experiences. 

    Another issue I observed is that students with AP credit are exempt from taking this class, which is unfortunate. In my opinion, CS 2110, the subsequent course, doesn't do as good a job teaching the material. On the other hand, many students who end up taking CS 1110 do not fully leverage the potential of the class due to their lack of commitment and effort in learning the material because CS 1110 is a required class. Even many potential CS majors who take the class don't take the class seriously, which severely hampers their foundational understanding for future CS classes.

    Despite the challenges posed by virtual learning, CS 1110 has played a pivotal role in cultivating my interest in Computer Science, thanks to its excellent teaching methods. I firmly believe that it stands out as one of the most well-taught classes offered at Cornell University. The core principles of debugging and computing, which I learned in this class, continue to resonate with me and greatly benefit my ongoing studies.

- ENGRG 1010: AEW Collab Workshop: CS 1110

    There were weekly meetings where we would fill out a sheet based on what we learned in CS 1110 that week. Overall, I don't think it impacted my grade in CS 1110 or my understanding of CS, but it was always more helpful to do more practice problems. It was all online in a Zoom breakout room, so it was not very interactive. AEWs might be better now that everything is back in person, so your milage may vary.

- ENGRG 1050: Engineering Seminar

    Introductory Seminar that all Engineers have to take. The class has a weekly meeting where you meet those sitting with you and talk about courses to take, major decisions, and opportunities on campus. I don't think it was of much use, but it is still a requirement for everyone.

- HIST 1200: FWS: Writing History

    I wrote about 4-5 essays throughout the entire semester. It was a relatively politically driven class. It was a moderate amount of work throughout the semester, with weekly attendance, group discussions, and essays. I needed it for FWS credit. I would say most FWS are a random coin toss. It is hard to say whether or not you will get an easy or hard one. 

- PHYS 1112: Physics 1: Mechanics & Heat

    Similar to Math 1920, I did a lot of the practice problems that were provided to make sure I had a strong foundational understanding of the topics. I think this is the easier of the two Engineering physics requirements. The class mainly consisted of weekly problem sets, discussions, and labs. The workload was moderately heavy, but it wasn't too difficult. 

- PSYCH 1101: Introduction to Pyschology

    I believe they heavily nerfed this class because of Covid. It is a fall-only class and was the first time being run with Covid. As a result, there were no exams and only a weekly quiz. All I would do was watch the weekly 1-hour lecture at 3x speed 30 minutes before the quiz. I would then use my short-term memory to remember and answer all the quiz questions. I don't think the class could get easier. However, exams have now returned, so the class might not be as easy as it used to be. Even then, I think a lot of good material was covered in that class, and I would still recommend taking it as a liberal study.

#### Reflection

Credits: 20

This semester was a relatively smooth semester for me. Since a large chunk of the student population didn't come to school in person, many of my days consisted of sitting in my room and listening to Zoom lectures. As a result, I didn't do much other than study, which may have made the classes easier because of the time I had on my hands. I talked to several other students online because many weren't at school, and I met them the following semester. Overall, CS 1110 was the highlight of the semester, which pushed me to keep exploring Computer Science in future semesters.

## Spring 2021 Difficulty: Hard
- BIOEE 1640: FWS: Topics in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology

    Like last semester's FWS, I wrote 4-5 essays for this class. Throughout the semester, the class seemed more straightforward than my other FWS, only for my grade in this class to be lower. Looking back, I don't know why I wanted an in-person FWS class, given that nobody interacted with each other. Furthermore, the grade I received and the work I did for the class only reinforced my idea that the FWS you chose was a toss-up. Many FWS classes are no work and give high grades, and many work you to the grave for a terrible grade. I don't know if it's the best system for Engineers, but I don't have a great alternative. 

- üëç ENGRD/CS 2110: Object Oriented Programming & Data Structures

    In the fall of my freshman year, I wasn't too sure what I wanted to major in. Additionally, I had done pretty well in CS 1110, inspiring me to take CS 2110 to keep a CS major within my possible major. In the semester I took the course, I believe it was less work than CS 1110. However, the material was slightly more complicated. I regret not spending enough time learning the core concepts of Object-Oriented Principles during class resulting in me cramming for many of the exams and quizzes rather than fully grasping the material. It wasn't until I went back through the course the following winter till I more deeply understood the nuances of Java and OOP. After going through the class again, I started to understand the material at a much higher level. While not difficult, I think I learned more from CS 1110. 
    
    The class continues to teach the foundations of Object Oriented Programming in Java by describing object-oriented principles, data structures like graphs, maps, and stacks, and algorithms that use these data structures, like Dijkstra's algorithm. Each of the six projects would reflect the topics covered in class and take 2 - 10 hours each. 
    
    Recently, CS 2110 has been made a lot more difficult with the introduction of Professor Myers teaching the course. My experience within the class compared to newer semesters might be significantly different. 
    
    Overall, I thought the bi-weekly quizzes frequently made me catch back up with the course, and the projects were ok. I think my workload this semester detracted from the potential learning I could've had within this class. If I were to go back in time, I would've spent much more time in this class learning the basics, given that I eventually became a CS major. 

- üëç ENGRI 1210: The Computing Technology Inside Your Smartphone

    Each Engineer must take an introductory engineering class in one of the engineering fields at Cornell. I'm glad the one I chose for the ECE major was well worth it. The course covered basic circuits, logic gates, and the basics of how computer hardware worked. 

    The workload consisted of weekly asynchronous videos we had to watch alongside a quiz for each of those lectures. This class further sparked my interest in the field of computer science as well as computer engineering. The exams were fair and represented the material we learned in class. I immensely enjoyed the constant reinforcement of the things we learned through weekly lectures, quizzes, and labs, which strengthened my understanding of the material. 

    Overall, this class was the highlight of my semester despite the heavy workload of my other classes. 

- Math 2930: Diffrential Equations Engineers

    This class was hard. While the workload was similar to Math 1920, taking this course and all the other heavy workload classes didn't let me understand what I was learning. I continued to do a large majority of the questions within the textbook to reinforce my knowledge of the subject. However, my studying methods were not as successful for this course as other courses. Given that they were online exams, many practice exams did not reflect the difficulty and type of questions on the exam. As a result, I didn't do the best on these exams. 

    Besides the exams, there were weekly problem sets, and the workload was moderately heavy. I only took this course because, at the time, I thought I would still be an ECE major, but I changed to a CS major by the end of the semester. 

- PE 1441: Intermediate Badminton

    I enjoyed my time playing badminton twice a week. Everybody there was great to talk and play with. I met some of my friends in the class, and it was a great break from all the mental work I was doing throughout the semester. 
    
- PHYS 2213: Physics II: Electromagnetism

    Like Math 2930, this class was a lot of work and conceptually tricky. For those who had AP Physics C credit, it is a robbery. The amount of content covered in this class is incomparable to AP Physics C.

    Besides the weekly problem sets, we also had four major labs throughout the semester, which ate up a lot of time. We covered basic circuits, magnetism, and various other topics that involved multi-variable calculus. This class was by far the most challenging class of the semester when incorporating the sheer amount of work and the conceptual difficulty of the topics. This was my least favorite class of the semester.

    However, I can't say that the class was all bad. I was lucky enough to land one of the select few in-person discussion sections where I met my girlfriend ‚ù§Ô∏è. 
    
- PHYS 4484: Teaching and Learning Physics
    Mandatory class for first-time TAs in the physics department. The course was a drag. We had an in-person class where we would have to turn in a 500-word essay about the videos we watched in the past week. I don't think this class should only be a single credit. It wasn't hard work, but it was not very interesting.

- ECE 2100: (Dropped)

    One of the only classes I dropped at Cornell. I was overloaded with credits this semester (25) and thought I could pull through. The class wasn't too hard, but I just ran out of time studying for my other classes. I dropped the class right before the first prelim because I had not gone to rank for the past two weeks, had some friend issues, and had another prelim the same night. The decision to drop out was hard because it would set me back from becoming an ECE major and bring down my perception of myself.

- PHYS 4485: Teaching Experience I
    
    TA Credit for Physics 1112

#### Reflection

Credits: 24 -> 20

Given how well I did in freshman fall, I overloaded myself with too much work this semester. I didn't learn much because I spread myself way too thin. Each class was a lot of work, quickly taking up days of my time either studying for exams or doing weekly problem sets. Additionally, the classes that ended up being a large amount of work were not my favorite, resulting in those classes feeling even worse. Although my grades didn't get much worse, I lacked a solid foundational understanding of the one CS course I took, and it was definitely a challenging semester.

<!-- ## Summer 2021

#### Three Things I Learned -->

## Fall 2021 Difficulty: Death
- BTRY 3080: Probability Models & Inference

    I was quite disappointed with this class, and I'm unsure why it turned out to be such a negative experience.  It was the first time the professor taught the class, and I initially took it because I heard it was easy. I was wrong. That was the previous professor that taught the course. The class was poorly taught, even though most concepts weren't too difficult. Although the class was marketed as an introduction to probability and statistics, I had a hard time following many of the things the professor was saying throughout the course, and it seems like I wasn't the only one. 

    The exam medians were in the solid 40-50% range for the semester. However, I think the professor heavily curved the class resulting in an A- Median. While the workload was relatively minimal, with only five problem sets all semester, cramming for the exam was exceptionally difficult.

    Overall, I would not say I liked taking the class with this professor, and the class only minimally improved my probability skills. However, I think different professors might be better at teaching the class. I took another probability course to understand the basics further and get an external spec requirement out of the way in ECE 3100.

- CS 2800: Discrete Structures

    The final requirement for me to affiliate with the Computer Science program was CS 2800. This course served as my introduction to proof-based classes, and I faced initial challenges as I navigated through unfamiliar territory. Set theory, in particular, delved into difficult topics for me to grasp, prompting me to seek independent study and frequent visits to office hours for assistance. However, my struggles in this class improved my ability to write proofs, which proved invaluable in CS 4820 Algorithms.
    
    Additionally, the workload of this class was weekly problem sets as well as weekly discussion sections. Many of these introduction classes are filled with problem sets that eat away at your time. CS 2800 is no different. For classes that I didn‚Äôt have any background in, it is really important to take the time to understand what you are learning foundationally. Each Computer Science topic is crucial to developing core computer science skills.
    
    The other topics covered in class, like Combinatorics, probability, DFAs, and number theory, were much more intuitive outside of set theory. Each of these concepts I had covered in different classes helped solidify my understanding of the material.
    
    A lot of people say that CS 2800 is difficult. I agree. As a strong weeder for CS majors, I believe that some of the concepts covered within CS 2800 provide a strong mathematical foundation of thinking for doing a computer science major at Cornell. While it is not my favorite class, I see the benefit of requiring all CS majors to take it.

- üëç CS 3110: Data Structures & Functional Programming

    Like CS 2110, I wish I had put more time into this class earlier in the semester. The concepts are excellent, the methodology of thinking is different, and the projects seem very interesting. Unfortunately, I never really had the time to invest in the excellent scopes for the projects until the end of the semester. The only project I dedicated my time towards was the final Jocalf project, where I ended up doing the excellent and bonus scope of the project. Building an interpreter for language seemed very interesting and only increased my interest in taking compilers in my junior spring. 

    Besides the projects, we had weekly labs to cover new functional programming techniques we had learned in class and four mini-in-class exams during the semester. 

    Again, I went back after the semester ended to revisit many topics I didn't fully understand. I went back and did excellent scope for the Red-Black tree project and went through many of the labs again to understand functional style data structures and a programming methodology. 

    CS 3110 is a great class that can transform your perspective on programming. While the data structures we learned, such as Maps, are similar to those in CS 2110, they are implemented differently in OCaml. Incorporating various functional programming techniques, such as mapping functions over collections and utilizing functional interfaces, has influenced my day-to-day programming. Even though my team's compiler project was written in Java, we often found functional programming, particularly pattern matching, to be superior, leading us to question our decisions. I firmly believe that CS 3110 and functional programming provide crucial insights for anyone aspiring to become a programmer.

- ‚≠ê ENGRD/ECE 2300: Digital Logic & Computer Organization

    I enjoyed this class. Similar to ENGRI 1210, it covers basic circuits, digital logic, and computer architecture. However, it covers them all in much greater depth. The class was taught well, and my background in ENGRI 1210 helped me understand the material better. The class digs into boolean algebra, digital clocks, caches, and how the hardware works when it is executing assembly instructions. The class gives a foundational understanding of the underlying hardware of your computer and is very helpful for future systems courses.

    This class is either a core ECE class or a part of the ENGRD 2300 CS 3420 track instead of CS 3410. While I believe that ECE 2300 and CS 3410 are both great classes, CS 3420 is a letdown I will build upon in my CS 3420 section.

    Within the class, we had bi-weekly problem sets and weekly labs. These labs would all be in Verilog, where we would code up (in hardware) finite-state machines, basic ALU units, and a full single-cycle processor. The labs are randomly assigned groups of two, which can be a pain if you and your partner don't have to align work schedules. 

    Overall, I enjoyed the professor's lectures and the content of the course. Although there was a lot of work throughout the class, I constantly prioritized this class over the others because the class felt more fun and exciting compared to my other classes. I highly recommend the course for those who can take ENGRD/ECE 2300!

- MATH 2940: Linear Algebra for Engineers

    Unlike Math 2930 last semester, I thought Math 2940 was much more manageable. The content made a lot more sense in the context of what we were learning. The workload was similar because we had weekly problem sets and exams.

	The core components of the course cover matrices. The class teaches matrix multiplication, change of base, and many other helpful tools. The class is critical for any future mathematical CS course anyone plans to take. The core concepts of matrix multiplication are fundamental in Machine Learning and Numerical Analysis. 
    
    Overall, I thought the class was relatively taught well. The in-person component of the class helped me understand the proofs and calculations that took place. However, I still ended up mostly cramming for all the exams, which may not have been the most helpful for the future Machine Learning classes I took. 

- TA for CS 1110

    I started TAing for CS 1110 because I enjoyed taking the course. We hosted weekly discussion sections and had two hours of office hours. TAing CS 1110 helped me reinforce my understanding of basic Python syntax and computing principles. Furthermore, I gained the critical skill of explaining my thoughts to students who might not know the subject.

- Recruiting for Internship

    Recruiting for an internship was equivalent to a four credit class. I will expand more upon it in a separate blog. Recruiting added a lot of stress to an already stressful semester.

<!-- - Reasearch (Dropped) -->

#### Reflection

Credits: 19

As if I had learned nothing the previous semester, I continued to overload myself this semester. I chose to take five heavy STEM classes in addition to recruiting for an internship. Each of these classes was a large amount of work individually, but together they became very hard to manage. Having around 3-4 problem sets due a week made diving deeper into any subject difficult. Additionally, I hadn't been recruited for an internship prior, so it was a learning experience doing leetcode and learning to apply to places consistently. This semester was by far the most challenging regarding my stress levels. Each day I would constantly be swamped with the number of problem sets I had to complete, exams I had to prepare for, and the constant threat that I wouldn't get an internship. 

## Spring 2022 Difficulty: Medium
- ARKEO 2668: Ancient Egyptian Civilization

    My philosophy for engineering liberal studies has always been to choose the most accessible classes. This class is no different. The class consists of a weekly post on Canvas and three multiple-choice exams. The workload for the class was minimal, which allowed me to divert much of my attention to my other classes.

    The class covers Egyptian history up until the last Egyptian dynasty. Overall, the class provided me with a free A+ and was a liberal study requirement to graduate. 

- ECE 3140/ CS 3420: Embedded Systems

    As the second part of the ECE 2300 -> CS 3420 path, the class was easy. However, I felt like there was a lot left on the table. The course covers basic assembly and calling conventions and includes basic threads and concurrency. The class isn't taught the best, and I wish there were a little more engagement other than the weekly async videos and quizzes.

    The projects covered within the class aren't that helpful in understanding the topics covered. Additionally, working on the board felt somewhat awkward because of the lack of support for the hardware. The final project requires you to use the board meaningfully to build a physical embedded system. 

    Besides the infrequent projects and weekly lecture quizzes, I didn't put much work into the class. The project partners are randomly assigned, which can also lead to issues. If I didn't need to take an ENGRD (2300), I definitely would've rather chosen to take 3410 strictly from the amount of material I would learn. I enjoy the systems component of Computer Science, so this class was moderately a letdown. However, if you want to get the systems requirement out of the way and don't need 2300, then you can take this course. While it won't help your learning as much, it is an option. Luckily in ENGRD 2300, I believe that the Verilog you learn in the course and the various foundational principles make up for the lack of material covered within this class. 

- CS 4700: Foundations of Artificial Intelligence

    I took this class because I still didn't have enough background to take the more advanced systems classes, and I needed another technical elective that I would find easy. However, this class was a lot harder than in previous semesters. The professors changed the course structure by incorporating additional content, which unfortunately resulted in a more superficial coverage of the topics and a lack of overall direction.

    The course content jumped from Bayesian reasoning to search algorithms, then to Markov models, supervised learning, and propositional logic. This rapid progression made it difficult to develop a solid foundation in any of the subjects, as we would barely scratch the surface of one topic before moving on to the next unrelated topic.

    Moreover, several newly introduced assignments were not thoroughly tested and seemed disconnected from the material we had covered. Although not excessively difficult, these assignments consumed significant time to complete. They encompassed both Python programming projects and written assignments.

    Throughout the course, many other classmates also complained about the course due to the unfair grading scheme, the 15-page prelim, or the unresponsiveness of TAs. 

    I believe my experience in CS 4700 only reflects that semester, as I heard the class has gotten a bit better with different professors and a more revised content schedule.

- CS 4670: Introduction to Computer Vision

    Similar to CS 4700, I wanted to take a few easier classes alongside CS 4820. Unlike CS 4700, the class was actually easy. The curriculum primarily focused on older aspects of computer vision, such as edge and line detection, which was somewhat disappointing considering we only touched on modern convolutional neural networks in the final week.

    The class consists of four projects that aren't too diffucult. I chose to work with a partner, which greatly reduced the overall stress level of the course. In addition to projects, we had one prelim and a final. The final was moved online, which made the median very high. I believe that more recent offerings of the course have become even easier because both exams are online.

    I would describe my learning experience in this class as a solid foundation in image detection basics. However, the course content lacks practical applications for modern computer vision. Instead, it primarily focuses on the historical development of computer vision over the past few decades. Overall, it was an enjoyable class that didn't significantly add to the stress in my schedule.

- üëç CS 4820: Intro Analysis of Algorithms


- üëç ECE 3100: Probability and Inference

    I took another probability class because I felt like I didn't learn enough from BTRY 3080, and I wanted to fulfill my ECE external spec with another 3k+ ECE class. Like BTRY 3080, the topics covered basic Bayesian logic, components of set theory, normal distributions, and other statical tests. 

    I enjoyed the course more than BTRY because the professor was a lot more fun, her lectures were clearer, and the homework (although more) was closely tied to the source material. Additionally, a few programming assignments were a fun addition to simulating probability results.

    There was even a final project provided where we had to simulate the spread of Covid-19 and model it through Python code. However, I think the final project has gotten discontinued since I took the class.

    The one downside to the class is how the difficulty scales throughout the semester. The content covered for the first 4/5 of the class was very straightforward, but the content got a lot harder for the final exam. As a result, the previous exam medians of 80% became 50% for the final. However, I don't think the difficulty of the last part of the course detracts from the overall content and learning I received throughout the course.

#### Reflection

Credits: 22

Despite the seemingly intense semester with five STEM classes and one liberal study, the semester was a lot easier than the previous semester. CS 4670, CS 3420, and ARKEO 2668 were small amounts of work for an easy grade. As a result, I only spent time doing the remaining three courses. Initially, I had heard that CS 4700 was easy, but it turned out that they revamped the course with the new professor and made it astronomically harder. 

For CS 4820 and ECE 3100, it was always a consistent amount of work studying for exams and doing the problem sets.

I was lucky enough to get an interview for Amazon in early spring, where I landed the internship successfully. I ended up going to Amazon the following summer for my sophomore summer.

    With my internship concluding at Amazon in the prior summer, I began recruiting starting in the summer. Similar to last year, I spent a large majority of my time recruiting for internships during the semester. I ended up taking two fewer courses to make sure I had enough time to recruit. I can't stress the importance of recruiting early. There were many people I knew that didn't end up getting the internships they desired because they started late and didn't prepare well enough. Personally, I ended up landing an internship at Citadel Securities, where I will be working on the Low Latency Software/FPGA Engineering Team.
