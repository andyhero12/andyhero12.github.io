My thoughts on Cornell Courses I've taken. My experiences may be different from others due to the 
more strict Covid-19 restrictions and virtual classes during my freshman year. 

üëç indicates a class I really enjoyed.

‚≠ê indicates a transformative class I strongly recommend taking.

Semester Difficulty Ratings: {easy, medium, hard, death}.

Background:
- Intended Major
    - I came in as an ECE major in the College of Engineering
- Programming Background
    - I didn't touch a single line of code coming into Cornell
- Math Background
    - I did subset of Multi-Variable Calculus in high school
    - I never qualified for any awards for competition math.
