## Fall 2020 Difficulty: Medium
- Math 1920: Multivariable Calculus for Engineers

    Given that I had taken a simpler version of Multivariable Calculus in high school, the first half of the class was relatively simple. I did every problem in the textbook to ensure I understood the foundations of our learning. I finished over seven notebooks of writing just for homework, practice problems, and exams. The latter half of the course was new material and required much more thought and time to understand what was happening. Overall, an excellent introduction to my first college-level math course.

- ‚≠ê CS 1110: Intro Computing Using Python

    One of, if not the best introductory courses in computing (Fall Version with Professor Walker White). Although I never scored the high 90s on my exams, the foundational concepts, the weekly labs, projects, and lectures kept me motivated throughout the semester. Professor White made short 10-minute videos multiple times a week teaching the new topics covered and reinforced those ideas during the three lectures a week. The combination of self-studying alongside examples during lectures accelerated the rate of learning I achieved throughout the semester. Additionally, the class and projects were well structured, which helped people without any background in computer science. Each week we would cover new topics such as basic operators, objects, lists, and even generators.

    One regret I have is working with partners within the class. The projects aren't nearly large enough to warrant splitting up the work, and given that CS 1110 is an intro class, it takes away from an individual's learning. Through the projects, people should be encouraged to learn the core concepts. I routinely learned much more by debugging through tasks rather than immediately giving up, going to office hours, or asking my partner. The projects I worked alone on were far better learning experiences. 

    Another issue I observed is that students with AP credit are exempt from taking this class, which is unfortunate. In my opinion, CS 2110, the subsequent course, doesn't do as good a job teaching the material. On the other hand, many students who end up taking CS 1110 do not fully leverage the potential of the class due to their lack of commitment and effort in learning the material because CS 1110 is a required class. Even many potential CS majors who take the class don't take the class seriously, which severely hampers their foundational understanding for future CS classes.

    Despite the challenges posed by virtual learning, CS 1110 has played a pivotal role in cultivating my interest in Computer Science, thanks to its excellent teaching methods. I firmly believe that it stands out as one of the most well-taught classes offered at Cornell University. The core principles of debugging and computing, which I learned in this class, continue to resonate with me and greatly benefit my ongoing studies.

- ENGRG 1010: AEW Collab Workshop: CS 1110

    There were weekly meetings where we would fill out a sheet based on what we learned in CS 1110 that week. Overall, I don't think it impacted my grade in CS 1110 or my understanding of CS, but it was always more helpful to do more practice problems. It was all online in a Zoom breakout room, so it was not very interactive. AEWs might be better now that everything is back in person, so your milage may vary.

- ENGRG 1050: Engineering Seminar

    Introductory Seminar that all Engineers have to take. The class has a weekly meeting where you meet those sitting with you and talk about courses to take, major decisions, and opportunities on campus. I don't think it was of much use, but it is still a requirement for everyone.

- HIST 1200: FWS: Writing History

    I wrote about 4-5 essays throughout the entire semester. It was a relatively politically driven class. It was a moderate amount of work throughout the semester, with weekly attendance, group discussions, and essays. I needed it for FWS credit. I would say most FWS are a random coin toss. It is hard to say whether or not you will get an easy or hard one. 

- PHYS 1112: Physics 1: Mechanics & Heat

    Similar to Math 1920, I did a lot of the practice problems that were provided to make sure I had a strong foundational understanding of the topics. I think this is the easier of the two Engineering physics requirements. The class mainly consisted of weekly problem sets, discussions, and labs. The workload was moderately heavy, but it wasn't too difficult. 

- PSYCH 1101: Introduction to Pyschology

    I believe they heavily nerfed this class because of Covid. It is a fall-only class and was the first time being run with Covid. As a result, there were no exams and only a weekly quiz. All I would do was watch the weekly 1-hour lecture at 3x speed 30 minutes before the quiz. I would then use my short-term memory to remember and answer all the quiz questions. I don't think the class could get easier. However, exams have now returned, so the class might not be as easy as it used to be. Even then, I think a lot of good material was covered in that class, and I would still recommend taking it as a liberal study.

#### Reflection

This semester was a relatively smooth semester for me. Since a large chunk of the student population didn't come to school in person, many of my days consisted of sitting in my room and listening to Zoom lectures. As a result, I didn't do much other than study, which may have made the classes easier because of the time I had on my hands. I talked to several other students online because many weren't at school, and I met them the following semester. Overall, CS 1110 was the highlight of the semester, which pushed me to keep exploring Computer Science in future semesters.

## Spring 2021 Difficulty: Hard
- BIOEE 1640: FWS: Topics in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology

    Like last semester's FWS, I wrote 4-5 essays for this class. Throughout the semester, the class seemed more straightforward than my other FWS, only for my grade in this class to be lower. Looking back, I don't know why I wanted an in-person FWS class, given that nobody interacted with each other. Furthermore, the grade I received and the work I did for the class only reinforced my idea that the FWS you chose was a toss-up. Many FWS classes are no work and give high grades, and many work you to the grave for a terrible grade. I don't know if it's the best system for Engineers, but I don't have a great alternative. 

- üëç ENGRD/CS 2110: Object Oriented Programming & Data Structures

    In the fall of my freshman year, I wasn't too sure what I wanted to major in. Additionally, I had done pretty well in CS 1110, inspiring me to take CS 2110 to keep a CS major within my possible major. In the semester I took the course, I believe it was less work than CS 1110. However, the material was slightly more complicated. I regret not spending enough time learning the core concepts of Object-Oriented Principles during class resulting in me cramming for many of the exams and quizzes rather than fully grasping the material. It wasn't until I went back through the course the following winter till I more deeply understood the nuances of Java and OOP. After going through the class again, I started to understand the material at a much higher level. While not difficult, I think I learned more from CS 1110. 
    
    The class continues to teach the foundations of Object Oriented Programming in Java by describing object-oriented principles, data structures like graphs, maps, and stacks, and algorithms that use these data structures, like Dijkstra's algorithm. Each of the six projects would reflect the topics covered in class and take 2 - 10 hours each. 
    
    Recently, CS 2110 has been made a lot more difficult with the introduction of Professor Myers teaching the course. My experience within the class compared to newer semesters might be significantly different. 
    
    Overall, I thought the bi-weekly quizzes frequently made me catch back up with the course, and the projects were ok. I think my workload this semester detracted from the potential learning I could've had within this class. If I were to go back in time, I would've spent much more time in this class learning the basics, given that I eventually became a CS major. 

- üëç ENGRI 1210: The Computing Technology Inside Your Smartphone

    Each Engineer must take an introductory engineering class in one of the engineering fields at Cornell. I'm glad the one I chose for the ECE major was well worth it. The course covered basic circuits, logic gates, and the basics of how computer hardware worked. 

    The workload consisted of weekly asynchronous videos we had to watch alongside a quiz for each of those lectures. This class further sparked my interest in the field of computer science as well as computer engineering. The exams were fair and represented the material we learned in class. I immensely enjoyed the constant reinforcement of the things we learned through weekly lectures, quizzes, and labs, which strengthened my understanding of the material. 

    Overall, this class was the highlight of my semester despite the heavy workload of my other classes. 

- Math 2930: Diffrential Equations Engineers

    This class was hard. While the workload was similar to Math 1920, taking this course and all the other heavy workload classes didn't let me understand what I was learning. I continued to do a large majority of the questions within the textbook to reinforce my knowledge of the subject. However, my studying methods were not as successful for this course as other courses. Given that they were online exams, many practice exams did not reflect the difficulty and type of questions on the exam. As a result, I didn't do the best on these exams. 

    Besides the exams, there were weekly problem sets, and the workload was moderately heavy. I only took this course because, at the time, I thought I would still be an ECE major, but I changed to a CS major by the end of the semester. 

- PE 1441: Intermediate Badminton

    I enjoyed my time playing badminton twice a week. Everybody there was great to talk and play with. I met some of my friends in the class, and it was a great break from all the mental work I was doing throughout the semester. 
    
- PHYS 2213: Physics II: Electromagnetism

    Like Math 2930, this class was a lot of work and conceptually tricky. For those who had AP Physics C credit, it is a robbery. The amount of content covered in this class is incomparable to AP Physics C.

    Besides the weekly problem sets, we also had four major labs throughout the semester, which ate up a lot of time. We covered basic circuits, magnetism, and various other topics that involved multi-variable calculus. This class was by far the most challenging class of the semester when incorporating the sheer amount of work and the conceptual difficulty of the topics. 

    However, I can't say that the class was all bad. I was lucky enough to land one of the select few in-person discussion sections where I met my girlfriend ‚ù§Ô∏è. 
    
- PHYS 4484: Teaching and Learning Physics
    Mandatory class for first-time TAs in the physics department. The course was a drag. We had an in-person class where we would have to turn in a 500-word essay about the videos we watched in the past week. I don't think this class should only be a single credit. It wasn't hard work, but it was not very interesting.

- ECE 2100: (Dropped)

    One of the only classes I dropped at Cornell. I was overloaded with credits this semester (25) and thought I could pull through. The class wasn't too hard, but I just ran out of time studying for my other classes. I dropped the class right before the first prelim because I had not gone to rank for the past two weeks, had some friend issues, and had another prelim the same night. The decision to drop out was hard because it would set me back from becoming an ECE major and bring down my perception of myself.

- PHYS 4485: Teaching Experience I
    
    TA Credit for Physics 1112

#### Reflection

Given how well I did in freshman fall, I overloaded myself with too much work this semester. I didn't learn much because I spread myself way too thin. Each class was a lot of work, quickly taking up days of my time either studying for exams or doing weekly problem sets. Additionally, the classes that ended up being a large amount of work were not my favorite, resulting in those classes feeling even worse. Although my grades didn't get much worse, I lacked a solid foundational understanding of the one CS course I took, and it was definitely a challenging semester.

- TA for CS 1110

    I started TAing for CS 1110 because I enjoyed taking the course. We hosted weekly discussion sections and had two hours of office hours. Taing CS 1110 helped me reinforce my understanding of basic Python syntax and computing principles. Furthermore, I gained the critical skill of explaining my thoughts to students who might not know the subject.

- Recruiting for Internship

    Recruiting for an internship was a four credit class on its own. I will expand more upon it in a separate blog. Recruiting added a lot of stress to an already stressful semester.

<!-- - Reasearch (Dropped) -->

#### Reflection

As if I had learned nothing the previous semester, I continued to overload myself this semester. I chose to take four heavy STEM classes in addition to recruiting for an internship. I hadn't been recruited for an internship prior, so it was a learning experience doing leetcode and learning to apply to places consistently. This semester was by far the most challenging in terms of my stress levels. Each day I would constantly be swamped with the number of problem sets I had to complete, exams I had to prepare for, and the constant threat that I wouldn't get an internship.
