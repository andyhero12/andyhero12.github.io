My thoughts on Cornell Courses I've taken. My experiences may differ from others due to the 
strict Covid-19 restrictions and virtual classes during my freshman year. I'm better at applied components of computer science compared to theory. 

üëç indicates a class I really enjoyed.

‚≠ê indicates a transformative class I strongly recommend taking.

## Fall 2020 Difficulty: Medium
- Math 1920: Multivariable Calculus for Engineers

    Given that I had taken a simpler version of Multivariable Calculus in high school, the first half of the class was relatively simple. I did every problem in the textbook to ensure I understood the foundations of our learning. I finished over seven notebooks of writing just for homework, practice problems, and exams. The latter half of the course was new material and required much more thought and time to understand what was happening. Overall, an excellent introduction to my first college-level math course.

- ‚≠ê CS 1110: Intro Computing Using Python

    One of, if not the best introductory courses in computing (Fall Version with Professor Walker White). Although I never scored the high 90s on my exams, the foundational concepts, the weekly labs, projects, and lectures kept me motivated throughout the semester. Professor White made short 10-minute videos multiple times a week teaching the new topics covered and reinforced those ideas during the three lectures a week. The combination of self-studying alongside examples during lectures accelerated the rate of learning I achieved throughout the semester. Additionally, the class and projects were well structured, which helped people without any background in computer science.

    One regret I have is working with partners within the class. The projects aren't nearly large enough to warrant splitting up the work, and given that CS 1110 is an intro class, it takes away from an individual's learning. Through the projects, people should be encouraged to learn the core concepts. I routinely learned much more by debugging through tasks rather than immediately giving up, going to office hours, or asking my partner. The projects I worked alone on were far better learning experiences. 

    Another issue I observed is that students with AP credit are exempt from taking this class, which is unfortunate. In my opinion, CS 2110, the subsequent course, doesn't do as good a job teaching the material. Consequently, many students who end up taking CS 1110 do not fully leverage the potential of the class due to their lack of commitment and effort in learning the material.

    Despite the challenges posed by virtual learning, CS 1110 has played a pivotal role in cultivating my interest in Computer Science, thanks to its excellent teaching methods. I firmly believe that it stands out as one of the most well-taught classes offered at Cornell University. The core principles of debugging and computing, which I learned in this class, continue to resonate with me and greatly benefit my ongoing studies.

- ENGRG 1010: AEW Collab Workshop: CS 1110

    There were weekly meetings where we would fill out a sheet based on what we learned in CS 1110 that week. Overall, I don't think it impacted my grade in CS 1110 or my understanding of CS, but it was always more helpful to do more practice problems. It was all online in a Zoom breakout room, so it was not very interactive. AEWs might be better now that everything is back in person, so your milage may vary.

- ENGRG 1050: Engineering Seminar

    Introductory Seminar that all Engineers have to take. The class has a weekly meeting where you meet those sitting with you and talk about courses to take, major decisions, and opportunities on campus. I don't think it was of much use, but it is still a requirement for everyone.

- HIST 1200: FWS: Writing History

    I wrote about 4-5 essays throughout the entire semester. It was a relatively politically driven class. It was a moderate amount of work throughout the semester, with weekly attendance, group discussions, and essays. I needed it for FWS credit. I would say most FWS are a random coin toss. It is hard to say whether or not you will get an easy or hard one. 

- PHYS 1112: Physics 1: Mechanics & Heat

    Similar to Math 1920, I did a lot of the practice problems that were provided to make sure I had a strong foundational understanding of the topics. I think this is the easier of the two Engineering physics requirements. The class mainly consisted of weekly problem sets, discussions, and labs. The workload was moderately heavy, but it wasn't too difficult. 

- PSYCH 1101: Introduction to Pyschology

    I believe they heavily nerfed this class because of Covid. It is a fall-only class and was the first time being run with Covid. As a result, there were no exams and only a weekly quiz. All I would do was watch the weekly 1-hour lecture at 3x speed 30 minutes before the quiz. I would then use my short-term memory to remember and answer all the quiz questions. I don't think the class could get easier. However, exams have now returned, so the class might not be as easy as it used to be. Even then, I think a lot of good material was covered in that class, and I would still recommend taking it as a liberal study.

#### Reflection
This semester was a relatively smooth semester for me. Since a large chunk of the student population didn't come to school in person, many of my days consisted of sitting in my room and listening to Zoom lectures. As a result, I didn't do much other than study, which may have made the classes easier because of the time I had on my hands. I talked to several other students online because many weren't at school, and I met them the following semester. Overall, CS 1110 was the highlight of the semester, which pushed me to keep exploring Computer Science in future semesters.
