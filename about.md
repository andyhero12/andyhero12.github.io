Hi! I'm Andrew, and I'm a B.S, M.Eng Alum (2020 - 2024) who studied Computer Science at Cornell University.

### Interests

My interests lie within Computer Architecture, Compiler Development, and Distributed Systems. I love seeing just how the hardware and software interact together to power our modern computers.
